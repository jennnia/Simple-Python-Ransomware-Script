# Simple-Python-Ransomware-Script

🌟 This ransomware script encrypts files in a specified folder and decrypts them only if the correct password is provided.

How It Works:

Key Generation: Creates and saves an encryption key (encryption_key.key).
File Encryption: Encrypts all files in the target folder using Fernet encryption.
Password Verification: Requires the correct password (r4ns0mw4r3 4tt4ck) to decrypt.
File Decryption: Restores the original files if the password is correct.
Use Case: Simulates ransomware behavior for educational purposes.

❗️Note: The script is intended only for educational purposes.
